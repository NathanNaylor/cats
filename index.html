    <p>
        Not only are cats some of the softest house pets, but most cats require little to no help from you to maintain their soft shiny coats of fur. Cats also do not require constant attention, they are adept at entertaining themselves in almost any circumstance. Cats come in almost any color, and everyone most likely has their own preference however, orange is definitively the best color for cats.
